E-commerce Application Development

Technologies: Java, Spring Boot, Twilio, Stripe, Razorpay, REST API, MySQL

Order Status Notifications: Implemented SMS functionality using Twilio to notify users of order status changes (e.g., Pending to Shipped, Shipped to Delivered). Configured Twilio and integrated it into the application for seamless communication.

Payment Gateway Integration: Successfully integrated the Stripe payment gateway for secure transactions. Designed a checkout flow with a JSON response containing payment status, message, and checkout URL, redirecting users to the Stripe demo checkout page.

Transaction Management: Developed a transaction service to record payment details and save transactions in the database upon successful order processing.

Cart Management: Implemented logic to automatically remove purchased items from the user's cart upon order placement.

Adaptability: Researched and evaluated multiple payment gateway options (Paytm, Razorpay, and Stripe) to find the best fit for the project, overcoming challenges like API key generation and KYC requirements.
